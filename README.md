## 🔄 Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with SSR & static optimization
- **React 19** - UI library with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform

## 🌐 API Integration

Fetches data from public Reddit API endpoints:
- `https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/.json` - Posts data
- `https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/popular.json` - Popular subreddits

**Note**: Image loading uses a server-side proxy (`/api/proxy-image`) to bypass CORS restrictions, ensuring compatibility across all devices including mobile.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Reddit API returns max 100 posts per request (no pagination)
- Private subreddits are inaccessible
- Some third-party hosted images may fail due to CORS
- Videos and non-image posts are filtered out
- No user authentication required (public subreddits only)

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from git:

```bash
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to Vercel
```

### Environment Variables

None required for basic functionality. Optional:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` - Override Google Analytics ID

### Analytics & Ads

- Google Analytics is loaded from `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Google AdSense is loaded globally from `src/app/layout.tsx` with publisher ID `ca-pub-3491512248260741`

## 📊 Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Android)
